## FAQ

**Do VPN services actually slow down internet speeds significantly?**

Premium VPNs like NordVPN, CyberGhost, and ExpressVPN typically reduce speeds by only 3-8% during testing, maintaining fast enough connections for 4K streaming and large file downloads. Budget services or overloaded servers cause more noticeable slowdowns exceeding 20-30% reductions. Choose servers geographically close to your location minimizing distance-related latency, and select WireGuard protocol over OpenVPN when speed matters most. Test multiple server locations finding optimal performance for your specific network conditions.

**Can I use VPNs to access streaming services blocked in my country?**

CyberGhost provides dedicated streaming servers specifically optimized for unblocking Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, BBC iPlayer, and other geo-restricted platforms. NordVPN's SmartPlay feature automatically selects best servers for streaming without manual configuration. Surfshark and ExpressVPN reliably bypass VPN detection on major streaming platforms. However, streaming services actively block known VPN IP addresses, so connection success varies by provider and server—premium services update IP addresses faster maintaining consistent access.

**Are free VPN services safe enough for everyday browsing?**

Proton VPN offers the only genuinely safe free tier providing unlimited bandwidth, strong encryption, no-logs policy, and Swiss privacy jurisdiction without selling user data. Most free VPNs monetize through selling browsing data to advertisers, injecting tracking cookies, or serving targeted advertisements compromising the privacy VPNs should protect. TunnelBear's limited 2GB free tier provides safe testing but insufficient for regular use. Avoid completely free services from unknown providers—premium VPNs cost $2-3 monthly through long-term subscriptions, worthwhile investments for genuine privacy.
